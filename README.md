# ðŸ”¥ Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction using Ridge Regression

This project is a web-based application to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using meteorological and environmental features.  
The app is built with **Flask (Python backend)** and uses a **Ridge Regression model** for predictions.
